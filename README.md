## Description:
Microservices have grown increasingly popular in the last few years. That's why Red Hat has released Quarkus in 2019. Quarks is a Kubernetes-native Java framework. It takes low memory consumption and has fast first response time. It becomes more popular among Java Developers.

The goal of this project is to compare microservice application created with Spring Boot and with Quarkus. And find out if Quarkus is really better in microservice world so we can remain state-of-the-art.
